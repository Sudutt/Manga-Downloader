# Manga-Downloader

*For those who are limited by network bandwidth and like to read manga at their own pace.*

## v1
This was an attempt driven by frustation due to slow loading of pages while reading online.

While the decision to download the current manga was then supported by scraping, it later led to feature like in-built search for mangas,  multi-threaded downloads for same chapter & updating all manga in current folder.

Currently v1 supports only `isekai-scans.com` (Hats off to you guys!!)

## v2
This is a future attempt to add multi-website support & simplify the code for better debugging & development

## v3
We also hope to add a simple GUI (instead of the current CLI) for better reach of the utility
